    <!-- @DEPRECATED
        Metrics results defined by DLM while integration with sonar, jira & pdihub is not developed 
        Once integration is done, we use it to overload calculated metrics (with rationale)
        When an average is calculated it is done using ncloc and weight of all of its componets, i.e.
            Average(x) = SUM[1:N] (x_n * ncloc_n * weight_n) / (SUM[1:N](ncloc_n * weight_n))
        Sum is the summatory of the given metric of all the components
